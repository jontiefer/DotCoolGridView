# Tiferix.DotCoolGridView
The Tiferix.DotCoolGridView control is an expansion of the native .NET DataGridView control which has added stunning visual effects.  The DotCoolGridView has effects such as adjustable gradient column headers and background.  In addition, both the cells and column headers can utilize alpha-blending and display translucent color cells over the background.  Some other significant features include background images that can be merged both with gradient backgrounds and displayed behind alpha-blended cells, columns and rows.  The DotCoolGridView is a separate part of the DotCoolControls control library and references some of the classes in this library.
